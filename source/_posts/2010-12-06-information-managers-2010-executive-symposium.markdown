We are going to give the keynote at the [2010 Executive Symposium](http://www.information-management.com/conferences/top25/).  This event brings together the 25 Top Information Managers of 2010 in a live, interactive session highlighting today's best information managers and people to watch in 2010 and beyond.  This executive event is an opportunity for information management leaders to meet and engage peers and showcase expertise across silos of business and IT. The event will examine creativity in information management, what leadership looks like in the 21st century and thoughts on what's in store for 2011 and beyond.
