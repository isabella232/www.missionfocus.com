[We](http://imintel.org) gave a seminar at [Oak Ridge National Labs](http://ornl.gov) a few weeks ago on our work with [large data and cloud computing](http://www.ornl.gov/ornlhome/calendar/calendar_full.cfm?Id=5104).  The seminar was well attended and the discussions were thought provoking.

Abstract from the seminar.

The Conceptual Underpinnings for Ultra-Large Scale, Unified Data-space Management

**Abstract**
A Data-space system seeks to develop a means to ingest structured and unstructured data of any format into a unified data store. Current, modern approaches to data base management limits modification of the data model or use of the data outside of its model.

Ultra-Large Scale (ULS) Data-space infrastructure is a technology stack with universal storage layers for: 1) unstructured data; 2) structured data; and 3) data/knowledge models. A fourth layer represents the means by which one can look into this Unified Data-space according to a chosen perspective or view to the data. The concept key to overcoming repetitive data integration is to unify the data without integrating it.

The solution developed to meet the minimal set of universal artifacts to describe structured data that could be used to display or capture data from any model is called the Data Description Framework (DDF). DDF is an abstraction over models that take data and semantics ingested from any number of silos and implements these within the storage model of choice. DDF seeks to minimize transformation of data, and instead, decouples data from models and models from storage schema. DDF avoids integrating or harmonizing data models up front. The native data and semantics become one unified framework; complete and undistorted. Upon this a whole new species of applications can be built using unified data without ever having to engage in the onerous task of data model harmonization.
