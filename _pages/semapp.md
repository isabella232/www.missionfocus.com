# SemApp

## What it is

SemApp is a semiotic compute & storage apparatus, built on an open-source cloud technology stack, for unifying and operationalizing Big Data, including geospatial, temporal, human, social, cultural, behavioral, as well as traditional Intel data types and all modalities from documents to streaming video.

## How it works

A lightweight ingest system takes all manner of data (structured, semi-structured, unstructured) as it lies and throws it onto the cloud computing floor. An amalgam of massively parallel processes continuously mine, exploit, and enrich data, lifting, shaping, and connecting information into a rich interconnected web. Data managers maintain and cultivate the information topology to optimize collection resources and make data more reliable and useful. Knowledge engineers integrate and enrich domain-models to support SOM and ABI. Analysts apply new tools to explore, associate, exploit, and visualize both information and processing, creating products that provide insight while enriching the entirety of data holdings. Commanders and war-fighters employ new applications to perform comprehensive mission SA, continuous agile assessment, planning, reporting, and execution.

## What it does

This unification of the data is the first step necessary to achieve
advanced analysis envisioned by analysts to solve the toughest
problems requiring access to the full diversity of data at scale.
SemApp breaks the data barriers and support all the
processing to put all of our data and computational Intel assets in the service of the warfighter. SemApp operationalizes Big Data.
